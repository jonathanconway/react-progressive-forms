# React Progressive Forms

This a small example of how you might go about building progressively-enhanced forms with ReactJS, which operate through regular form POSTs if Javascript is disabled, but take advantage of React's built-in client-side DOM-diffing if Javascript is enabled.

## Installation


```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonathanconway/react-progressive-forms
cd react-progressive-forms
npm install
```

Then you can run it:

```sh
npm start
```
